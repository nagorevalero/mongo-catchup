Learn to use conditional statements (`if`/`else`)

## Introduction

Conditionals work the same way as other languages, but we need:
  * Brackets `()` to enclose the condition.
  * Curly braces `{}` to enclose the code "body" executed following this condition.

See the following example:
```js
const a = getSomeValue();

if (a === 10) {
  // do these things
} else if (a === 20) {
  // something else?
} else {
  // whatever
}
```
## Exercise

To complete the following, you will have to:
 * use `if`, `else if` and `else` to write conditionals.
 * use the strict equality operator `===` to compare values.

1. Define a function `getNumberSign` that takes a number and returns either 'zero',
   'positive' or 'negative' depending on its sign:

```javascript
> getNumberSign(3);
'positive'

> getNumberSign(0);
'zero'

> getNumberSign(-5);
'negative'
```

[Example solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT9kAUK_kmY)

*Note*: in all the following examples, we'll use the strict equality operator `===`
(instead of `==`), as it can prevent some bugs, and is viewed as one of the best practices
in the JavaScript community. In your code, you should ideally use `===` as well when doing
comparisons (unless you have a good reason not to!).


## Exercise

A colleague just asked you some help to debug their code.

```javascript
const isValidLength = (phoneNumber) => {
  const validLength = 10;
  if (phoneNumber.length == validLength) {
    true;
  } else {
    false;
  }
}
```

When calling this function, something doesn't work as expected. What fix can you suggest
to solve the problem? 

You'll know the function works if you manage to have the expected output when running in
`node`:

```javascript
> isValidLength('00');
false

> isValidLength('0011223344');
true
```

## Challenge

Write a `fizzBuzz` function in JavaScript. As a reminder, this function should take a
number as argument, and then either:
  * Return "Fizz" if this number is divisible by 3.
  * Return "Buzz" if this number is divisible by 5.
  * Return "FizzBuzz" if this number is divisible by *both* 5 and 3.
  * Otherwise, Return the number itself.

Here's an acceptance criteria of how the function should behave:
```js
> fizzBuzz(3); 
'Fizz'

> fizzBuzz(5);
'Buzz'

> fizzBuzz(8);
8

> fizzBuzz(15);
'FizzBuzz'

> fizzBuzz(18);
'Fizz'

> fizzBuzz(20);
'Buzz'
```
